Project work for Microprocessor and Interfacing Course. Design of a Keypad based Door$Security$Control on a 8086 microprocessor. 

## To do

Design

- [x] Add solenoid (added solenoid control to PinPC7 of IC U2 (8255A))
- [x] Make Design file clutter free (More reorganisation needed)
- [x] Redo Mem Interfacing (not required)
- [ ] Redo 8253 interrupts

Code

- [ ] Update welcome screen and other display aspects
- [ ] remove code for servo
- [ ] add solenoid control (see next item)
- [ ] ULN2003A is needed modified pins are as follows: PB1 for solenoid lock(active high) PA5 for buzzer(active low and no need to change code for it)



Documentation
